<p>The Welcoming Woods</p>

<p>
    As I walk in the forest, the <a href="Birds.html"> birds</a> are chirping and welcoming. It's a beautiful sunny spring day, with fluffy
    clouds in the sky. Gentle is the <a href="Breeze.html">breeze</a> that passes through my hair calmly.
</p>

<p>
    Around  me  are  strong  thick  trees  that  look  as  if  they  can  never  be  moved;  firmly  rooted  deep  in  the  ground.
    As  I  look  up,  green  fresh  leaves  hover  over  me  like  a  canopy. I  notice  <a href="GentleMovements.html">gentle  movements</a>  at  the  tips  of  the  trees
    as  they  sway  in  the  wind; as  if  they  are  dancing.
    Small  squirrels  are  jumping,  and  chasing  one  another  around  in  the  entwined  branches,  talking  to  one  another.
